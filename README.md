aggregate-commands
==================

Run a bunch of commands in a single process and log them apart. It has been essentially developed for being used in a [npm script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts), instead of `command1 & command2 & command 3`.

Globally
--------

Install

```sh
npm install -g aggregate-commands
```

Usage

```sh
aggregate-commands /path/to/commands-file.json
```

or

```sh
aggregate-commands key
```

where key is declared in a `aggregate-commands` object of `package.json`

In a npm script
---------------

Install as dev dependency

```sh
npm install --save-dev aggregate-commands
```

Use in a script (in your `package.json`)

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "my-script": "aggregate-commands commands-file.json"
  }
}
```

Commands format
---------------

The command file is an array of commands (JS or JSON), a command being itself an array with following elements:

* (optional) is the command required?
  * `true` the master will exit as soon as this command dies (normally or not)
  * `false` the master will ignore death of this command (normal or not)
  * otherwise (set to `null` if you want to be explicit) default behavior for the master is to exit if command dies with non-0 exit code
* (required) the command key, used for logging
* (required) the command's main binary
* (optional) the rest of the array are command's arguments

Example:

```json
[
  [ null,   "logger1",  "node", "-e", "console.log('I exit (code = 0) just after my work, but master won\\'t care')" ],
  [ true,   "required", "node", "-e", "console.log('I die (code ≠ 0) in 2 seconds and that will kill master'); setTimeout(process.exit.bind(process, 14), 2000)" ],
  [ false,  "ignored",  "node", "-e", "console.log('I die (code ≠ 0) in 1.5 seconds but matster won\\'t care'); setTimeout(process.exit.bind(process, 16), 1500)" ],
  [ null,   "logger2",  "node", "-e", "console.log('I die (code = 0) in 2.5 seconds but I\\'ll be killed first'); setTimeout(process.exit.bind(process, 0), 2500)" ]
]
```

This sample command file will produce following output:

```
2014-11-19 22:46:13 [logger1 ] I exit (code = 0) just after my work, but master won't care
2014-11-19 22:46:13 [ignored ] I die (code ≠ 0) in 1.5 seconds but matster won't care
2014-11-19 22:46:13 [logger1 ] Terminated with code 0
2014-11-19 22:46:13 [logger2 ] I die (code = 0) in 2.5 seconds but I'll be killed first
2014-11-19 22:46:13 [required] I die (code ≠ 0) in 2 seconds and that will kill master
2014-11-19 22:46:15 [ignored ] Terminated with code 16
2014-11-19 22:46:15 [required] Terminated with code 14
2014-11-19 22:46:15 Terminated by previous command, killing remaining processes…
2014-11-19 22:46:15 [logger2 ] Terminated with code 143
```

Note: You can declare your commands file as JSON (`.json`) or plain Node module (`.js`, don't forget `module.exports = …`) if you want to add comments

### Declare commands in package.json

If you don't want to use a separate file, you can embed your commands descriptor in `package.json` under the `aggregate-commands` key:

```json
{
  "aggregate-commands": {
    "my-commands": [
      Your commands go here
    ]
  }
}
```

Simply run `aggregate-commands my-commands` and it will use this configuration.

Why not using simply "command1 & command2"?
-------------------------------------------

* If `command1` fails, it won't fail the whole script
* If `command2` ends, `command1` stays in background (possibly forever, meaning you'll have to `ps` and `kill` it)
* You cannot distinguish outputs and logs get all mixed up

It's better to have a single master process, but it's a pain to write, so here it's already done.

Real life example
-----------------

Your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "aggregate-commands": "^1.0.0",
    …
  },
  "scripts": {
    "watch-css": "the script that watches and compiles your CSS",
    "watch-templates": "the script that watches and compiles your HTML templates",
    "watch-js": "the watchify command building your JS",
    "watch": "aggregate-commands watch"
  },
  "aggregate-commands": {
    "watch": [
      ["css",  "npm", "run", "watch-css"],
      ["tpls", "npm", "run", "watch-templates"],
      ["js",   "npm", "run", "watch-js"]
    ]
  }
}
```
